### Project Overview

***ChoppyMic: Microphone background-noise and choppy-audio analysis tool***

- How many times have you been in zoom meetings where someone’s microphone was misbehaving, with either a high level of background electronic noise or choppy audio (e.g., due to a faulty cable)?
- Often people are affected and they don’t even know, due to people thinking it isn’t polite to tell others that their audio signal sucks :-)
- In this project you will build a program that asks users to utter a predefined sequence of words (including pauses, karaoke-style) while it is recording from the microphone.
- It then analyses the audio recording to identify parameters of the microphone such as, the signal-to-noise ratio, and to see if there is any choppiness in the audio (and quantify it)
- Ideally, the program should also determine the frequency range that the microphone is able to record (sound quality)
